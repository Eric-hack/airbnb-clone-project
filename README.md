## Technology Stack
## Technology Stack

### Django  
A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API. It provides built-in tools for authentication, ORM (Object Relational Mapping), and secure development.

### Django REST Framework (DRF)  
An extension of Django that provides additional tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs. It simplifies serialization, authentication, and permission handling.

### PostgreSQL  
A powerful relational database used for data storage. It ensures reliability, scalability, and strong data integrity for managing users, property listings, bookings, and reviews.

### GraphQL  
A query language for APIs that allows for flexible and efficient data querying. It enables clients to request only the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching.

### Celery  
A distributed task queue used for handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications, processing payments, or scheduling background jobs.

### Redis  
An in-memory data store used for caching and session management. It improves application performance by reducing database load and speeding up data retrieval.

### Docker  
A containerization tool that ensures consistent development and deployment environments. It allows the application to run reliably across different systems.

### CI/CD Pipelines  
Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes. They help maintain code quality, reduce manual work, and ensure faster, reliable releases.

### Entity Relationships
- A **user** can have multiple **properties** (host role).  
- A **user** can make multiple **bookings** for different **properties** (guest role).  
- A **property** can have multiple **bookings**.  
- A **booking** is linked to one **property** and one **user**.  
- A **booking** can have one associated **payment**.  
- A **property** can have multiple **reviews**, each written by different users.  

## Feature Breakdown

### API Documentation
The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard, ensuring clarity, consistency, and ease of integration with external systems. Django REST Framework provides a comprehensive RESTful API for CRUD operations, while GraphQL offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.

### User Authentication
Endpoints: `/users/`, `/users/{user_id}/`  
This feature allows new users to register, authenticate securely, and manage their profiles. It ensures that access to resources is protected and user sessions are properly maintained.

### Property Management
Endpoints: `/properties/`, `/properties/{property_id}/`  
Hosts can create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings through this feature. It enables users to showcase available accommodations with essential details like location, pricing, and availability.

### Booking System
Endpoints: `/bookings/`, `/bookings/{booking_id}/`  
This feature enables guests to make, update, and manage bookings for properties. It tracks check-in and check-out details, ensuring a smooth reservation process for both guests and hosts.

### Payment Processing
Endpoints: `/payments/`  
Handles financial transactions associated with bookings. It ensures that payments are securely processed, tracked, and linked to reservations, improving trust and accountability on the platform.

### Review System
Endpoints: `/reviews/`, `/reviews/{review_id}/`  
Allows users to post and manage reviews for properties they have stayed at. This helps build credibility for hosts and provides valuable feedback for future guests.

### Database Optimizations
Indexing and caching strategies are implemented to improve database performance. Indexes speed up data retrieval for frequently accessed queries, while caching reduces database load by serving repeated requests from memory.
